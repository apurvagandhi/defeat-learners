# defeat-learners

## OVERVIEW
In this assignment, you will generate data that you believe will work better for one learner than another. This will test your understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various learners. You will submit the code for the project in Gradescope SUBMISSION. There is no report associated with this assignment.

## Learning Objectives
The specific learning objectives for this assignment are focused on the following areas: 

Supervised Learning â€“ Learner Strengths and Weaknesses: Demonstrate an understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of a Decision Tree learner as compared to a Linear Regression Learner. 
2 ABOUT THE PROJECT
In this project, you will evaluate the relative strengths of two types of supervised learners: a linear regression learner and a decision tree learner. Specifically, you will write a module that generates datasets that will be used by the learners. Your goal is to 1) produce datasets that enable a linear regression learner to consistently outperform a decision tree learner and 2) produce datasets that enable a decision tree learner to consistently outperform a linear regression learner. 

Your data generation implementation should use a random number generator as part of its data generation process. We will pass your generators a random number seed. Whenever the seed is the same you should return exactly the same data set. Different seeds should result in different data sets. This project may require readings or additional research to ensure an understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different types of learners.
